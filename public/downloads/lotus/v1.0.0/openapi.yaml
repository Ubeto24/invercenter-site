        \    - Full amount authorization\r

        \        \r

        \        - The issuer authorizes a transaction and later the Acquirer
        clears that transaction based on the full amount of the purchase.\r

        \            \r

        \        - In this case, the transaction amount and the clearing amount
        will match.\r

        \            \r

        \        - That information can be found in the transaction->reason_code

        \            \r

        \    - Authorization amount and clearing amount differs:\r

        \        \r

        \        - The merchant may request a pre-authorization for the issuer,
        however in some cases of car rental or hotel stays, the final amount to
        be cleared may be lower in the clearing, however the clearing amount
        will never be greater than the clearing amount.\r

        \            \r

        \        - That information can be found in the transaction->reason_code
        = 1402 in the first presentment call.\r

        \            \r

        \    - Multi clearing:\r

        \        \r

        \        - Some merchants may choose to clear an authorization in two or
        more clearing requests. For example, an online store may clear the
        transaction as the products are being delivered to the customer.\r

        \            \r

        \        - In this scenario, the 1st presentment call will contain the
        amount of the first product as provided by the Acquirer and the field
        transaction->reason_code = 1403. That process is going to repeat until
        the final product is delivered or the Acquirer states that it is the
        final clearing of that authorization. Therefore the field
        transaction->reason code = 1404 in the 1st presentment.\r

        \            \r

        \            - 2\\. During the clearing cycle, the Acquirer shipped the
        first product worth of 100,00 USD, therefore the Issuer is going to
